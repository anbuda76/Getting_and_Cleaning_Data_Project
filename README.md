# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==============================================================

### Instruction

This repository contains my work for the course project for the Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.

I created a script called "run_project.R" which will solve all assigments.

It does the following:

- Download the file and put the file in the temp folder 
- Read in the data from files
- Fix column names
- Merge the training and test sets to create one data set
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- An an other data set tidy the set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The end result is shown in the file "tidydata.txt" saved in "C:/Getting and Cleaning Data/UCI HAR Dataset/"
